# Intelligent Predictive Maintenance for CubeSat Batteries

## 🚀 Overview
This project presents a research-driven approach to predicting the **State of Health (SoH)** and **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** of Lithium-Ion batteries used in small satellites (CubeSats).
By leveraging **LSTM Deep Learning** and the **NASA PCoE Battery Dataset**, this framework aims to prevent sudden mission failures in space.
